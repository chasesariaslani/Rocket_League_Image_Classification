# Rocket_League_Image_Classification
A model set to classify goals, shots, etc in Rocket League using video footage.

Objective:
Rocket League is in the top 10 for Esports games and is one of the most viewed and has prize money recently hitting 350k (1 million last year). As the game progresses, coaches need more statistical analysis tools in order to determine whether their esports players need to be substituted mid playoffs and put in a fresh player to disrupt teams in a best of seven format.

In this project, we are taking video game footage from Rocket League and creating a convolutional neural network which learns from the images fed in. We use image sequencing to classify the images in the video. By doing this, we will be able to determine if a player is performing above or below their average using statistical analysis.
